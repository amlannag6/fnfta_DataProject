To perform OCR on the PDF, extract the desired data, and save it into a text file, you can use the PyPDF2 and pytesseract libraries in Python. Here's an example code snippet to get you started:

python
Copy code
import PyPDF2
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    pdf_file = open(pdf_path, 'rb')
    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)

    num_pages = pdf_reader.numPages

    text_data = []
    for page_num in range(num_pages):
        page = pdf_reader.getPage(page_num)
        page_image = page.extractText()
        text_data.append(page_image)

    pdf_file.close()
    return '\n'.join(text_data)

def extract_financial_data(text):
    data = {}
    # Define the keywords to search for
    keywords = {
        'Cash and Equivalents': None,
        'Restricted Cash': None,
        'Accounts Receivables (AR)': None,
        'Inventory': None,
        'Long-term Investments': None,
        'Investment in GBEs': None,
        'Related Party Loans': None,
        'Investment in Trust Funds': None,
        'Other Assets': None,
        'Total Financial Assets': None
    }

    # Extract data using OCR
    for keyword in keywords:
        index = text.find(keyword)
        if index != -1:
            start_index = index + len(keyword) + 1
            end_index = text.find('\n', start_index)
            value = text[start_index:end_index].strip()
            keywords[keyword] = value

    return keywords

# Example usage
pdf_path = '<path_to_your_pdf_file>'
output_file = 'financial_data.txt'

# Perform OCR on the PDF
extracted_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)

# Extract the desired financial data
financial_data = extract_financial_data(extracted_text)

# Save the financial data to a text file
with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
    for key, value in financial_data.items():
        line = f'{key}: {value}\n'
        file.write(line)

print(f'Financial data extracted and saved to {output_file}.')
Make sure to install the required libraries by running pip install PyPDF2 pytesseract pillow before executing the code. You'll also need to have Tesseract OCR installed on your system.

Replace <path_to_your_pdf_file> with the actual path to your PDF file, and the extracted financial data will be saved to the financial_data.txt file.

Note that OCR may not always produce 100% accurate results, so you may need to adjust the code or manually verify and correct the extracted data as needed.
